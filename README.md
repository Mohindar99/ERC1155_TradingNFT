# ERC1155_TradingNFTs
It is a project regarding the NFT trade of panther eyes.

# Description:
This project's main agenda is to mint some different types of NFT's of panther eyes and use them to transfer between the users. In this project I have written the code from the scratch in order to make my desktop images as an NFT with the help of decentralized cloud IPFS .
With the help of IPFS I could manage to make the NFT's live and use them as a transactional assert .


The code was completely hard coded with the solidity programming language.
